# Sum Array Algorithm in C

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file with C extension**: Save your code in a file with a `.c` extension, e.g., `sum_array.c`.

2. **Import library for input and output**: Include the standard input-output library `stdio.h` at the beginning of your code.

3. **Create a main function (the entry point)**: Define a `main()` function as the entry point of your program.

4. **Create an array of n elements with values**: Declare an array with the desired number of elements and initialize it with values.

5. **Create a sum value as a holder**: Declare a variable to hold the sum of the array elements.

6. **Create a for loop to iterate through the array**: Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element of the array and calculate the sum.

7. **Print the sum value**: Output the sum value.
